Make number row accessible.

## Layer 2
![screenshot](screenshots/2.png?raw=true "Layer 2")


Symbols, braces and brackets are home row, numbers added (probably should remove this was only used to remedy my `cmd+1` tab issue since `cmd` and `mod 1` could not be pressed simultaneously with the same finger).

## Layer 3

Some media stuff, more to add.
